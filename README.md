# Ziokoban 

## Introduction

At a 5-day Functional Scala course by John A. De Goes in September 2018, I was introduced to the [ZIO](https://zio.dev) library. Afterwards I really wanted to start playing around with this library. So I started this project.
I have been regularly working on it ever since, trying to keep up was every new release of the library.

This is a playground project, so its main aim is to get to know the ZIO library. I chose to make a game, because I wanted something with garanteed side effects. I chose [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban), because it is one of my favorite games ever!

This is a follow-up to my Ziokoban-CLI project. This time I want to focus on a richer UI.
